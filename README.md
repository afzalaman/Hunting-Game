# Hunting-Game
Hunting is a two-player game, played on a board consists of n x n fields, where the first player (call him fugitive) tries to run away, while the second player (the hunter) tries to capture him/her. Initially, the character of the fugitive is at the center of the board, while the hunter has four characters (one at each corner). The players take turns moving their character (hunter can choose from 4) 1 step on the board (they cannot step on each others character). The objective of the hunter is to surround the fugitive in at most 4n steps, so it won’t be able to move.
Implement this game, and let the board size be selectable (3x3, 5x5, 7x7 → turns are 12, 20, 28). The game should recognize if it is ended, and it has to show the name of the winner in a message box and automatically begin a new game.
